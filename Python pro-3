#You’re building a small program for a school. The user must enter the student’s name and marks in three subjects. The program should calculate the total, average, and display a grade. If marks are not between 0 and 100, show an error message. 
Concepts: Input/Output, data validation, arithmetic, if–elif–else.
name = input("Enter student's name: ")

m1 = float(input("Enter marks for Subject 1: "))
m2 = float(input("Enter marks for Subject 2: "))
m3 = float(input("Enter marks for Subject 3: "))

if (m1 < 0 or m1 > 100) or (m2 < 0 or m2 > 100) or (m3 < 0 or m3 > 100):
    print("Error: Marks must be between 0 and 100 only.")
else:
    total = m1 + m2 + m3
    average = total / 3

    if average >= 85:
        grade = "A"
    elif average >= 70:
        grade = "B"
    elif average >= 50:
        grade = "C"
    else:
        grade = "D"

    print("\nStudent Name:", name)
    print("Total Marks:", total)
    print("Average Marks:", average)
