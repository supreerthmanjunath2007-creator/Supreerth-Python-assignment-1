#A traffic system records the average speed of vehicles every hour for 12 hours.
Write a program that: Reads 12 speed values (floats). Calculates the average speed. Displays whether traffic flow was “Slow” (avg < 40), “Normal” (40–80), or “Fast” (avg > 80).
Concepts: list input, loop, conditional check, average calculation.
speeds = []

for i in range(12):
    value = float(input("Enter speed for hour " + str(i+1) + ": "))
    speeds.append(value)

average_speed = sum(speeds) / 12

print("Average speed:", average_speed)

if average_speed < 40:
    print("Traffic flow: Slow")
elif average_speed <= 80:
    print("Traffic flow: Normal")
else:
    print("Traffic flow: Fast")
